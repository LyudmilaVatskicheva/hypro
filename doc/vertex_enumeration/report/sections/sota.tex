\section{State of the art}
\label{section_sota}
Dantzig's simplex algorithm (1947) is one of the oldest algorithm to solve linear optimization problems. Its geometric interpretation allowed the creation of a family of algorithms for the vertex enumeration problem called the pivoting algorithms. This section presents the simplex and one of the pivoting algorithms: Fukuda's algorithm.
