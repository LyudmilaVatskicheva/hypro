\section{State of the art}
\label{section_sota}
Dantzig's simplex algorithm~\cite{simplex} (1947) is one of the oldest algorithms to solve linear optimization problems. Its geometric interpretation allowed the creation of a family of algorithms for the vertex enumeration problem called the pivoting algorithms~\cite{pivoting}. This section presents the required background knowledge regarding the simplex algorithm as well as one pivoting algorithm: the Avis-Fukuda algorithm~\cite{fukuda} (refereed as Fukuda's algorithm in the rest of the paper).
