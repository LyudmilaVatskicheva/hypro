TODO: Reachability analysis?

Any pivot that keeps the primal feasibility stays inside the polytope.


The principle of reachability analysis with hybid systems is being able to maintain a convex polyhedron containing all the possible states of the system at any given time. Some operations might have to be applied to the polyhedron such like intersections, unions ect. The difficulty of these op√©rations greatly depends on the description used for the polyhedron.

Def: V poly
Def: H poly
Theorem: there is a V and a H descripion for each polyhedron.

Being able to swich between these descripions is an important issue to overcome in reachability analysis.

The following part describe an algorithm to convert a bounded H polyhedron (an H polytope) into its V description and extend it to the unbounded case.
