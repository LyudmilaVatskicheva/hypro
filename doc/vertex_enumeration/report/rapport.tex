\begin{abstract}
When a digital controller interacts with physical quantities, discrete behaviour is mixed with continuous behaviour. Such systems are called hybrid and they are omnipresent, e.g. planes, nuclear reactors, cars, just to name a few. Their analysis and safety verification is crucial, as they are often safety-critical. One approach to verify safety of these systems is reachability analysis via flowpipe construction: the construction of an over-approximation of all reachable states of the system within a bounded time horizon. This method makes use of geometric shapes as a representation for state sets of a given system. This paper is a contribution to the HyPro project~\cite{hypro}, a library dedicated to the state representation of hybrid systems by a variety of geometric shapes. Among other operations, the library provides conversions between bounded $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ polyhedra. The purpose of this paper is to extend the conversion to unbounded $\mathcal{H}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ polyhedra through the adaption of a pivoting algorithm: the Avis-Fukuda algorithm.
