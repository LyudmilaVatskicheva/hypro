# Usage {#usage}

Here we show some examples on how to use the library. As the interface is mostly unified, we start by showing examples on our box implementation and on our H-polytope implementation.

- @ref example_box.cpp "Working with boxes."
- @ref example_HPolytope.cpp "Working with H-polytopes."

Additional examples such as @ref example_bouncingBall.cpp show how to manually create a hybrid automaton and invoke the built-in reachability analysis algorithm (Reach.h).
